# Restaurant_review_analysis
This project involved preparing a restaurant review dataset plagued by missing values,  inconsistent data types, duplicates, and multi-valued fields. The cleaned data was uploaded to a MySQL database, providing a solid foundation for detailed analysis and enabling data-driven business insights in the restaurant sector

This project uses the dataset from Kaggle: Zomato_EDA (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavuikey/zomato-eda/data)
